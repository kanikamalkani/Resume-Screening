# Resume-Screening using python
#generalized version of a resume screener. The file resume.csv is the user's input

The goal of this project will be to build a resume screening system that can automatically scan a large number of resumes and identify the most suitable candidates based on specific job requirements.

Here are the main steps involved in building a resume screening system using Python:

Data preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the resumes to extract relevant information such as work experience, education, and skills. This can be done using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, stemming, and named entity recognition.

Job requirements: Next, you need to define the job requirements based on the skills, education, and work experience needed for the position. This can be done by analyzing the job description and creating a list of required skills and qualifications.

Feature extraction: Once the job requirements are defined, you can use NLP techniques to extract features from the resumes that are relevant to the job requirements, such as work experience, education, and skills.

Machine learning model: The next step is to build a machine learning model that can classify resumes based on their suitability for the job. This can be done using various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines (SVM).

Evaluation: Finally, you need to evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. You can use techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the model.
